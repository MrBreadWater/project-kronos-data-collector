### Privacy Statement

By using this Plugin, you agree to allow for the anonymous collection of timelapses and photos generated by Octoprint. No identifying information will be attatched to the files. 

# What Data is Collected

The only data collected is the rendered timelapses and snapshots of failed prints.

# Data Retention

The timelapses will be kept indefinitely, as is appropriate.

# Data Usage

The Data is hand sorted into a dataset, and used to generate a neural network. No timelapses will be a part of the final product, and none of them will ever be released to the public.
