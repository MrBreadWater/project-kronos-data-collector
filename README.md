# project-kronos-data-collector
Simple Octoprint Plugin to collect a dataset for Project Kronos: https://github.com/MrBreadWater/project-kronos

# Install
As of the time of writing, auto-install is unavailable. However, it will be available as soon as my request to add the data collector to the official Octoprint Plugin Repo is accepted. When that happens, simply go to Octoprint's plugin manager, and search for Project Kronos Data Collector. Click the install button and restart when prompted.

To install manually, go to Octoprint's plugin manager, click the "Get More" button at the bottom of the screen, and paste the following URL into it: https://github.com/MrBreadWater/project-kronos-data-collector/archive/master.zip

Let it run, then when prompted, reboot Octoprint.
