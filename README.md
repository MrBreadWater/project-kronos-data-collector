# Project Kronos Data Collector
A simple Octoprint Plugin to help collect a Neural Network dataset of 3D Printing timelapses.

# Install
Project Kronos Data Collector is pending acceptance into the official Octoprint Plugin Repository. Until then, install like so:

Go to Octoprint's plugin manager, click the "Get More" button at the bottom of the screen, and paste the following URL into it: https://github.com/MrBreadWater/project-kronos-data-collector/archive/master.zip

Simply follow the on screen directions from that point to finish the install.

Once it is accepted, the plugin will be installable using the built in Plugin Manager.

# Privacy Statement

By using this Plugin, you agree to allow for the anonymous collection of timelapses and photos generated by Octoprint. No identifying information will be attatched to the files, as they are entirely anonymous.

### What Data is Collected

The only data collected is snapshots of failed prints, and timelapses that Octoprint renders. Data is submitted for photos and timelapses upon cancellation of a print, and upon the rendering of a timelapse.

### Data Retention

The timelapses will be kept indefinitely, as is appropriate for each individual timelapse.

### Data Usage

The Data is hand sorted into a dataset, and used to generate a neural network. No timelapses will included as a part of the final neural network, only the variables generated by analysis of the overall dataset. No private timelapses will ever be released to the public.
