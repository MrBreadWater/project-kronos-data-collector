# Project Kronos Data Collector
A simple Octoprint Plugin to help collect a Neural Network dataset of 3D Printing timelapses.

# Install
Project Kronos Data Collector is pending acceptance into the official Octoprint Plugin Repository. Until then, install like so:

Go to Octoprint's plugin manager, click the "Get More" button at the bottom of the screen, and paste the following URL into it: https://github.com/MrBreadWater/project-kronos-data-collector/archive/master.zip

# Privacy Statement

By using this Plugin, you agree to allow for the anonymous collection of timelapses and photos generated by Octoprint. No identifying information will be attatched to the files, as they are entirely anonymous.

### What Data is Collected

The only data collected is snapshots of failed prints, and timelapses that Octoprint renders. Data is submitted for photos and timelapses upon cancellation of a print, and upon the rendering of a timelapse.

### Data Retention

The timelapses will be kept indefinitely, as is appropriate for each individual timelapse.

### Data Usage

The data is hand-sorted into a dataset, and used to generate a neural network. No timelapses will included as a part of the final neural network, only the variables generated by analysis of the overall dataset. No private timelapses will ever be released to the public. No third party companies will have access to the data. The data will only ever be stored on official Project Kronos computers/storage, and the server it's initially uploaded to.

### Disabling Data Collection and Uninstalling

To disable this plugin, go into your Octoprint settings, and on the side, click Project Kronos Daa Collector. Then, simply uncheck the "Enable?" checkbox and save your settings. 

To uninstall this plugin completely, go to your Octoprint settings and click on Plugin Manager. Simply find the plugin in the list of installed plugins, and click on the trash can to uninstall it. Follow any prompts that pop up.
